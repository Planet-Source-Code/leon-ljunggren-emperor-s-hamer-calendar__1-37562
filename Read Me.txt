1. What is this?
This is the calendar specaly made to suit The Emperor's Hammer. Just as the name
imply it's a calendar that can store important dates just like a normal paper 
calendar, only this is electronical and got a much more clean interface. It 
also contains a reminder program that will, if you chose so, remind you on the
correct date and time.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



2. Installation
When the program is started it is directly minimized to the system tray (lower right
corner of the screen). To bring up the program simply click on the icon in the 
system tray.
To make full use of the program a shortcut should be added to the autostart folder 
in the start menu, otherwise the reminder part won't work as it should.
The program isn't exactly hard to manage. When started you'll see a list of dates,
click on one and you'll see the information attached to it. To add a date klick 
"Add", to edit a record klick "Edit" etc.
If you wish to be reminded on the date (and time) then check the "Remind me" box in
the add/eddit window. If you don't wish to be reminded at a certain time on the date 
simply leave the time field be (00:00:00) and it will remind you as soon as the 
computer starts on the date you specified. If you miss a date (not having the program
running) then it will remind you as soon as it starts and tell you how much late the
reminder is.
The program checks for a reminder every minute, so there's no point in filling it
the seconds.
The reminder record is atomaticaly deleted after being viewd, the calendar record
on the other hand stays untill you delete it manualy.
To use the search funtions simply enter a word you wish to search for and the 
program will look through the subjects for it. If the "Complete Search"
checkbox is checked the porgram will also go trough the body of the record in 
search for a match.
The two records already there when you start the program for the first time is
hardcoded and you can not delete or in anyother way change them.
The theoretical limit of the number of records you can use is 65535. How ever
you'll run into problmes long beofre you reach this mark since the database will
simply take too long to load. There should be no problme with as many as 1000
records, and even 2000 should be ok, but after that you'd be pushing it.
Under the option section you can sync your computer's clock with a atom clock.
This works no matter which time zone you're in. Checking the "Auto sync" check
box will atomaticaly sync your computer clock each houer (as long as the program
is runing that is), this should only be used if you have a constant conection
to the net. If you have a firewall there might be some problmes with conection 
to the atom clock serve, opening port nr 13 should fix this problme (consult your 
router/firewall manual on how to do this).
Here you can also chose any sound you want to use when the reminder pops up, or
chose not to have a sound played.
